	Hi, I'm Kelly and I'm a graphic designer. I have a passion for creating. I love my family, friends, and my three best creations; Lucas, Alexis, and Addison. ( hence the name, laa designs! ) My style and aesthetic has range, and at the same time remains clean and modern. Good design is not about adding, but more about taking away, making a statement with the less is more philosophy. Successful design leaves a lasting impression and is truly timeless.
